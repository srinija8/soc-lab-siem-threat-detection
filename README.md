# 🛡️ SOC Lab – SIEM Threat Detection & Incident Response

## Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) lab focused on SIEM monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and threat hunting workflows.

The goal is to simulate enterprise SOC operations including:

- Security event monitoring (SIEM)
- Alert triage and investigation
- Threat detection and IOC correlation
- Incident response aligned with NIST 800-61
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Wazuh SIEM / ELK Stack
- Splunk (Detection Testing)
- Microsoft Defender (Lab Environment)
- Wireshark
- PowerShell & Python
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework

---

## Lab Architecture
(Architecture diagram will be added)

Components:
- SIEM Server
- Windows Endpoint
- Linux Endpoint
- Centralized Log Monitoring

---

## Detection Use Cases (Planned)
- Brute-force login detection
- Suspicious PowerShell execution
- Privilege escalation activity
- Abnormal authentication events

---

## Incident Response Workflow
Following NIST 800-61 lifecycle:

1. Preparation  
2. Detection & Analysis  
3. Containment  
4. Eradication & Recovery  
5. Lessons Learned  

---

## Project Goals
- Build enterprise-style SOC monitoring workflows
- Develop SIEM detection rules
- Practice threat hunting and log analysis
- Document real-world investigation scenarios
